# Securing-Bank-Details-using-Elgamal-Encryption
People now prefer using Online Banking Portals to know all related bank information, 
such as fund transfers, checking the transaction history etc. In the current busy society, 
people need their money to be safe, and hence they prefer to store it in banks. This brings 
about a clamour on banking applications to provide the customers with a fast, efficient 
and secure system. Now moving our attention to security, we will emphasise on the very 
aspect of a secure banking system which is the locus of this project. To stop intruders 
from accessing sensitive data, the banking portal needs to be safeguarded. Therefore we 
will be utilizing some encryption algorithm to ensure that the portal application and the 
associated data are safe, as there is a possibility of attack by the external sources to 
access the incorporated into this application system.
